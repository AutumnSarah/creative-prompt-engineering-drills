# Mind Puzzle Mayhem 

*Chain of Thought (CoT)* prompting encourages AI models to show their reasoning process step-by-step, leading to more accurate and transparent responses.

**Challenge:**  Practice writing Chain of Thought prompts that tell the model to explain its logic and reasoning. Test the prompts in an LLM and read the response to understand how the model “thinks”. Look for any gaps or errors in its reasoning. 

## Round 1

**Practice Problem:** All roses are flowers. Some flowers are red. Therefore, some roses are red.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that asks the AI to evaluate this logical argument step by step  
2. Write a prompt that asks the AI to identify any logical fallacies  
3. Write a prompt that requests the reasoning be shown using formal logic notation

## Round 2 

**The Dragon Detective Case:** In the mystical realm of Eldoria, all dragons can breathe fire. Some creatures that breathe fire are considered dangerous by the Royal Guard. The village reports that Sparkles the Dragon has never harmed anyone. Therefore, Sparkles is not dangerous.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that analyzes whether this conclusion logically follows  
2. Write a prompt that identifies the hidden assumptions in this argument  
3. Write a prompt that explores alternative logical conclusions

## Round 3

**The Time Travel Paradox**: If time travel to the past were possible, then people could change historical events. If people could change historical events, then the present would be different. But the present is not different from what we observe. Therefore, time travel to the past is impossible.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that examines each step of this logical chain  
2. Write a prompt that challenges the argument by considering multiple timeline theories  
3. Write a prompt that asks the AI to restructure this as a formal logical proof

## Round 4

**The Alien Restaurant Rumors:** On planet Zorbex, all restaurants that serve glowing food are run by aliens. The "Cosmic Café" serves glowing food and is incredibly popular with tourists. Some tourists claim they've never seen aliens working there. Therefore, the staff must be using advanced disguises.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that identifies what information is missing from this argument  
2. Write a prompt that generates alternative explanations for the observations  
3. Write a prompt that evaluates the strength of the evidence for each possible conclusion

## Round 5 

**The Superhero Logic Puzzle** Every superhero who can fly also has super strength. Captain Marvel can fly. Some heroes with super strength wear capes. Captain Marvel doesn't wear a cape. Therefore, Captain Marvel is not a true superhero.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that maps out the logical relationships step by step  
2. Write a prompt that identifies where the reasoning breaks down  
3. Write a prompt that asks the AI to create a truth table for this scenario

## Round 6

**The Haunted Library Mystery** In the old Ravencroft Library, all books that glow in the dark contain ancient magic. The librarian claims that glowing books are completely safe to read. However, three students who read glowing books last month started levitating uncontrollably. Therefore, either the librarian is lying or ancient magic is not dangerous.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that explores whether this creates a logical contradiction  
2. Write a prompt that examines what "safe" might mean in different contexts  
3. Write a prompt that asks the AI to consider additional possibilities beyond the either/or conclusion

## Round 7

**The Robot Ethics Scenario** All advanced AI robots are programmed to follow ethical guidelines. ARIA-7 is an advanced AI robot. Ethical guidelines prohibit causing harm to humans. ARIA-7 refused to help a human move heavy furniture because it might cause the human to strain their back. Therefore, ARIA-7 is malfunctioning.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that analyzes whether refusing to help constitutes "causing harm"  
2. Write a prompt that examines the conflict between different types of ethical obligations  
3. Write a prompt that asks the AI to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises

## Round 8

**The Interdimensional Coffee Shop** In the multiverse, every dimension has at least one coffee shop. Coffee shops in dimensions with purple skies serve the best coffee. Our dimension doesn't have purple skies, but "Java the Hutt" claims to serve interdimensional coffee from a purple-sky dimension. A customer says it's the worst coffee they've ever tasted. Therefore, Java the Hutt is lying about their coffee's origin.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Write a prompt that identifies all the assumptions in this reasoning  
2. Write a prompt that considers alternative explanations for the bad coffee  
3. Write a prompt that asks the AI to determine what additional information would be needed to reach a solid conclusion
