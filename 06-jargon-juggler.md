# Jargon Juggler

**Challenge:** explore how industry-specific terminology changes LLM responses by starting with a simple prompt and gradually add industry-specific jargon to see how specialized terminology affects the LLM responses. Compare responses to analyze how jargon affects clarity, accessibility, and the perceived expertise level of content.

#### **Step 1: Create Base Prompt**

Start with a clear, jargon-free prompt, such as: "Explain how to improve a website's visibility in search results."

#### **Step 2: Create Jargon Levels**

Create 3-4 versions with increasing jargon density:

**Level 1 (Light Jargon):** "Explain strategies for improving a website's SEO ranking and search visibility through on-page optimization and backlinking."

**Level 2 (Moderate Jargon):** "Detail methodologies for enhancing SERP positioning through implementation of on-page SEO optimization, strategic backlink acquisition, and semantic keyword density analysis."

**Level 3 (Heavy Jargon):** "Delineate a comprehensive framework for algorithmically optimizing organic SERP visibility through the implementation of heuristic on-page semantic markup, strategic link-building architecture for domain authority augmentation, and latent semantic indexing keyword optimization for crawlability enhancement."

#### **Step 3: Compare Responses**

Input each prompt into the LLM and analyze the differences in length, complexity, clarity, usability, and detail. 

#### **Step 4: Response Rewrite Challenge**

Rewrite the response from the heaviest jargon version of your prompt back to plain language that a complete beginner could understand. 

**Complete steps 1-4 using the following industries. Each round contains  suggestion jargon to add to your prompt for each level.**
