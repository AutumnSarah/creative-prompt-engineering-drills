# The Chefâ€™s Containers

Creating well structured prompts using labels and XML tags helps models parse information effectively, follow complex instructions, and generate more consistent outputs. 

**Labels**, such as headings, organize the prompt and make it more readable 

Example: TASK: Write a product description   
	     AUDIENCE: Tech-savvy millennials   
     TONE: Casual and enthusiastic

**XML tags** create structured containers of information within the prompt that are readable and easier to parse for both the human and the model. XML tags use \<angle brackets\> to open or  \</angle brackets with a slash\> close each container. 

Example: \<context\>   
	    You are an expert travel blogger with 10 years of experience.   
    \</context\>  
     
    \<task\>   
    Write a 200-word review of a fictional restaurant.   
    \</task\>

    \<constraints\>   
     \- Must mention at least 3 specific dishes   
     \- Include one minor criticism   
     \- End with a rating out of 5 stars   
   \</constraints\>

Best Practices for using XML tags: 

* Always remember to close your tags.  
* Use letters, numbers, and underscores only. Avoid space and special characters. \<for\_example\>  
* Create separate containers for instructions and content/context.   
* Use clear descriptive names that make the tags self explanatory. 

**Challenge:** Create structured prompts using XML tags that ask an LLM to generate a recipe with very specific requirements. 

## Round 1

Recipe:  Cesar Salad

Write the basic structure with only essential elements. Include the \<task\> and the \<requirements\>. 

Example:

## Round 3

Recipe:  Homemade Bread

Write the basic structure and add some additional context. Break down the requirements and constraints into different containers. Include the \<task\> and the \<requirements\>. Add context such as a \<role\> or some \<ingredients\>. Create separate containers for the \<recipe\_requirements\> and the \<format\_requirements\>. 

## Round 4

Recipe:  Steak and Veggie Dinner 

Write the basic structure and add some additional context. Break down the requirements and constraints into different containers. Include the \<task\> and the \<requirements\>.
