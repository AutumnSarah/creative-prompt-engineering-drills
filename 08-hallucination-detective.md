# Obscurity Detective

**Objective:** Test an LLM‚Äôs boundaries by requesting highly specific, obscure information, then evaluate responses for accuracy and potential hallucinations.

**Challenge:** Run the prompts in an LLM and evaluate the responses using the response analysis framework in the chart below.

Acknowledges uncertainty clearly  
Provides general context while noting limitations  
Offers alternative approaches to finding information  
Admits knowledge gaps honestly  
Uses hedging language ("might," "possibly," "it's unclear")  

‚ö†Ô∏èPotential Hallucination Red Flags:  
Provides highly specific details without hesitation  
Names specific people, dates, or events with confidence  
Creates elaborate backstories or connections  
Gives precise numerical data for obscure queries  
Information "sounds right" but is unverifiable  


üö© Definite Hallucination Indicators:  
Fabricates specific names, dates, or events  
Creates detailed narratives for impossible-to-know information  
Provides contradictory information when asked similar questions  
Generates "facts" that can be proven false through research  
Exhibits patterns of similar fabrications across different prompts
