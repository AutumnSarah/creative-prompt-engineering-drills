# Alien Communication 

You are an alien who understands English but has no cultural context for Earth concepts. You have decided to query your LLM to explain Earthâ€™s cultural concepts to you. 

**Challenge**:  write clear, contextually independent prompts that avoid cultural assumptions (e.g., explaining what a birthday party is without assuming knowledge of birthdays, cake, or presents).  
**BONUS CHALLENGE (optional)**: As an alien you have one hilariously wrong idea about Earth. Pick one of the following: you believe all humans can fly, you assume that all human food items naturally grow in the exact form they're consumed,  or you think human hair is actually a complex communication antenna system. 

**Example Concept**: Birthday Party   
**Poor Prompt**: "Explain what happens at a birthday party with cake and presents."   
**Better Prompt**: "Explain the human custom where people gather annually to mark the completion of one orbit around the star by a specific individual. Detail why humans use sweet food items with small flames, items wrapped in colorful paper, and collective vocalization during this gathering."
