# Zero to Few Transformation

Prompts that contain a few examples of the desired output are called *few-shot* prompts, while prompts that provide no examples are called *zero-shot* prompts.

**Challenge:** You'll be given silly zero-shot prompts that produce unpredictable or inconsistent results. Test the prompt in an LLM and judge the response. Transform each prompt into a few-shot prompt that gives the LLM clear guidance through examples, making the output more consistent, funnier, or more useful. Test the new prompt in the LLM and compare the responses.
