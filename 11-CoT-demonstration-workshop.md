# Demonstration Workshop

**Challenge:** Transform each zero-shot prompt into a powerful few-shot CoT prompt by adding some detailed examples that demonstrate the reasoning process.

**Tip:** Few-shot CoT isn't just about adding examples \- it's about demonstrating the thinking process. Create examples that show how to break down different types of problems (analysis, problem-solving, creative tasks, etc.) and teach the LLM your preferred reasoning methodology. In Few-Shot Chain of Thought prompting, your examples train the model on your specific approach to problem-solving. The better your demonstrations, the more consistently the AI will follow your preferred reasoning style. Few-shot CoT transforms zero-shot prompts by adding demonstrations of the thinking process. This "show, don't just tell" approach helps the AI understand not just what you want, but HOW you want it done.

## Round 1 

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "Analyze whether this movie review is positive or negative and explain your reasoning: 'The film's ambitious scope is undermined by its scattered narrative, though the cinematography occasionally dazzles.'"

**Your Task:** Transform this into a few-shot CoT prompt by adding examples that show how to:

* Identify positive and negative language  
* Weigh conflicting elements  
* Reach a balanced conclusion

## Round 2 

(You may want to find or create a recipe to use as context.)

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "This recipe calls for 2 cups of flour but I only have 1.5 cups. How should I adjust the other ingredients?"

**Your Task:** Create a few-shot CoT prompt that demonstrates how to:

* Calculate scaling ratios  
* Apply ratios to different ingredient types  
* Consider which ingredients need adjustment vs. which don't

## Round 3

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "Rewrite this blunt email to sound more diplomatic: 'Your proposal is completely wrong and won't work.'"

**Your Task:** Show through examples how to:

* Identify harsh language  
* Find diplomatic alternatives  
* Maintain the core message while softening delivery  
* Structure constructive feedback

## Round 4

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "Two roommates are arguing about cleaning responsibilities. One says the other never cleans, the other says they clean different things. How can they resolve this?"

**Your Task:** Demonstrate conflict resolution methodology:

* Identify underlying concerns vs. surface complaints  
* Find common ground  
* Propose structured solutions  
* Address prevention of future conflicts

## Round 5

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "Solve this logic puzzle: Amy, Bob, and Carol each have different pets (cat, dog, fish). Amy doesn't have the cat. The person with the dog sits next to Bob. Carol has an allergy to fur. Who has which pet?"

**Your Task:** Demonstrate the systematic approach:

* Set up a constraint table  
* Apply each clue methodically  
* Use process of elimination  
* Verify the solution

## Bonus Round: 

Find or create some code to use as context. 

**Zero-Shot Prompt:** "Find the bug in this Python function that's supposed to calculate the average of a list but returns the wrong result."

**Your Task:** Show the debugging process:

* Trace through the code execution  
* Identify where expected vs. actual results diverge  
* Explain the root cause  
* Provide the fix
